          <p class="lead">GoatHub was built by four Olin students for Codestellation, a hackathon at Brandeis University. Prior to constructing GoatHub, none of its creators had any  web development experience. GoatHub was made with a sole purpose: to provide the world with an immersive and interactive goat-viewing experience.</p>
